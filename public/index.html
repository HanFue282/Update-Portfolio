    <section class=" card card-body row">
        <p> My name is Hannah Joy Fuentes. I'm 21 years old, soon to be 22 on the 28th of Feburary, and I am 
            attending SMU Coding Bootcamp. I came to learn more about coding and for my future career in video game development.</p>
        <p> It has been sort of hard in the past couple of weeks, but I'm glad that there are teacher assistants to help us out when
            we become clueless on what to do next in our work. It's been fun learning about the functions and the layout of webpages
            on how they work. I'm still struggling, but at least it is challenging which means I'll have to put in the practice and hardwork
            to accomplish my dream career.</p>

        <p> 1. I like to draw when I am inspired from reading books, television shows, or music. I don't always draw so often nowadays, but I do
            practice. So I'll keep practicing until I am fully confident in my art work.</p>
        <p> 2. I like to play video games with my friends online. My favorite game series is Kingdom Hearts and my top series that I have always enjoyed
            is the Halo series.</p>
        <p> 3. I like corgis a lot. They're short and stubby, sorta like me, but they're much cuter with their loaf bread-like body. I have a video game
            idea that involves corgis, so I hope someday I can make it.</p>
        <p> 4. My favorite food is chicken nuggets. Especially the ones from Wendy's with the spicy nuggets. They are delicious!</p>
        <p> 5. I sometimes streams to talk to people while I play video games or practice drawing digitally.</p>
